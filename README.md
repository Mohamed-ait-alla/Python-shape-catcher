# Shape Catcher Game

## Description

**Shape Catcher** is a fun and interactive game developed using Python and the `turtle` graphics module. In this game, shapes fall from the top of the window, and your goal is to catch them using a bar that you can move left and right. Every time you catch a shape, you score points, and the game gets progressively more challenging as the speed of falling shapes increases. The game continues until you catch a white turtle, at which point the game ends.

## Features

- **Smooth gameplay**: Shapes fall smoothly, and the game responds to user input with minimal lag.
- **Increasing difficulty**: As you catch more shapes, the speed at which they fall gradually increases.
- **Nice interface**: The game uses the `turtle` module to create a visually appealing and straightforward game window.
- **Score tracking**: The score is updated in real-time as you catch the shapes.
